## Use

The composite pattern is useful in these situations:

- When a hierarchical structure (tree structure) is required.
- When it is necessary to treat individual objects and groups of objects in the same way.

## Sample Usage Scenario

- Consider a graphic organizer. This editor supports simple graphic objects (leaves) such as lines, circles and rectangles. At the same time, it can create complex graphic objects (composite) consisting of these simple objects. The composite pattern allows you to handle both individual and complex versions of these graphic objects in the same way.
