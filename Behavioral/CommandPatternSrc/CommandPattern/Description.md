## What is the Command Design Pattern?

The Command Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and support for undoable operations.

### Components of the Command Design Pattern

1. Command Interface
   The Command Interface is like a rulebook that all command classes follow. It declares a common method, execute(), ensuring that every concrete command knows how to perform its specific action. It sets the standard for all commands, making it easier for the remote control to manage and execute diverse operations without needing to know the details of each command.

2. Concrete Command Classes
   Concrete Command Classes are the specific commands, like turning on a TV or adjusting the stereo volume. Each class encapsulates the details of a particular action. These classes act as executable instructions that the remote control can trigger without worrying about the nitty-gritty details of how each command accomplishes its task.
